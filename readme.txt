Login without a password: Use this plugin to login via email verification, no password required.

== Description ==


#### A QUICK AND MODERN WAY TO LOGIN

Use this plugin to login without a password: It allows you to login via email verification, instead of a password login.

It will only work for registered admin email addresses.
To help agains spammer and brute force attacks, we set a security timer. Change the duration in the E-Mail Login options.

#### HOW IT WORKS

- Go to /wp-admin.
- Click „VERIFICATION PER E-MAIL“.
- Type your email and click „send“.
- Check you email’s and click the verification link.
- Admin Login checks if your link is valid and authenticates you.

The verification link expires after 10 minutes. 
Setup a limit for the „send“ button in the admin area, it will send the email after the timer expired.

Our method works with multiple accounts and login attempts, at the same time.

#### YOU DECIDE HOW TO LOGIN

We do not replace or modify the default WordPress login, this plugin will add a simple button to your admin area.
You can also change the limit of allowed login attempts using the timer in the admin panel.
